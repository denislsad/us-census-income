This is the second part of the project, in which I analyze the Census data on poverty and income. In this part, I explore the data on historical income distribution for households of different groups of origins/races in the United States (the latest Census data available is for 2021). 

With a help of visualization and statistics, I tried to accomplish the following tasks:
1. Explore the income distributions with a series of stacked bar charts and draw conclusions.
2. Show the changes in median incomes since the data started being collected.
3. Find the Pearson correlation coefficient to check if the changes are statistically significant.
    
    
After that, I highllight the key findings of this part of the project. The first part (about poverty) is available here: https://github.com/denislsad/us-census-poverty
